# DSA with python || python data structure and algorithm 


# List

# List is built-in dynamic array which can store elements of differetn data types.It is an ordered collection of item

# List stores references to the objects (elements) rather than storing the actual data itself






a=[10,20,'pigss',40,'True']



print(type(a))



# searching algorithms are used to locate a specific element within a data structure such as an array,list or tree

# sorting algorithms are used to arrrange the elements of a data structure such as an array list 


# basic shorting with sorted() function 

# sorted() function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable object 


numbers=[5,3,8,2,1]


sorted_numbers=sorted(numbers)

print(sorted_numbers)


# data structure and algorrithm using python is easy then  how can i manage to study artificial intellegence with python w
